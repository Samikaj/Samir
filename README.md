# CSUP-Mobile-Application

This is application for veterinary ordinations

### Project Overview
VET FOR PETT application is made because i noticed a lot of problems with treating animals in my country,
maybe not intentionally but more that they're busy with other stuff like work etc.
A lot of infections are available because that people forget that they should take care better of animals and give them treatment that they deserve. 
Examinations and Treatment is one of types that is in one ordination,also Vaccinations are one of main sources available,
Examinations and Therapies are unique and also a lot important thing that should be a information for user.Also there are displayed which place has food for animals and what kind of food is it.
It's supposed to inform customers where are Veterinary establishments,which of them is nearest to customer itself.
Every veterinary that is available in my country is showed on the application and you can see specifications for each one.
Also there is a description for each veterinary that has details about veterinary itself like address,treatments,phone number so you can contact them easily.
The idea is to make it easier for customers to have all these informations in one place and to even rethink that they should take care of animals just like 
they care for themselves,because at the end we all deserve to live happy and be healthy.
